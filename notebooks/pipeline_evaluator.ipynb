    "We use LangChain's `QAGenerateChain` to generate a set of question-answer (QA) pairs from the collection of PDF documents. This set will be used to evaluate the performance of the RAG pipeline.  \n",

We compare the accuracy rates of each pipeline to determine their effectiveness in delivering precise and contextually relevant responses based on the provided documents."
